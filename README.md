### ✅ Films Explorer  
An iOS app showcasing a list of films using TableView and segues. Tapping a row navigates to a detail screen displaying the film’s image, name, and description. The project demonstrates use of classes and inheritance, `performSegue`, and `prepare(for:sender:)` methods to pass data between views.
